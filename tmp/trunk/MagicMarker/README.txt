Current Live version supported: 2.3.x
**********************************************************************

Description:
	MagicMarker lets you easily classify and mark mobs simply my
	moving the mouse over them. This allows incredibly fast
	marking once of trash groups. Although not necessary for the
	addon to function, you can categorize mobs to use a diffent
	priority list of marks. This allows for consistent marking of
	targets to tank and crowd control. The categoriews and raid
	marks per category is currently hard coded. The addon will
	save your preferences for mark for each category so you will
	get consistent marking between sessions.

Todo:
	* Category editor
        * Target priority (higher priority targets use the earlier
          marks for that category).
